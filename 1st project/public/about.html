<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello i'm Waseeq, i'm currently learing the full stack web-development course on the udemy website and i've already completed
  studying the Data Analyst course. Learned python programming as well and also created some good looking dashboard
  on microsoft power BI.
</p>

<p>Let me tell you about my past, I completed my Diploma in Civl engineering and I'm sad to say that i didn't liked the work of a 
  civil engineer and i strated looking for a new route and i found the Data Analyst roadmap then i worked on it for a few month, after that
  i stated searching to learn more and i landed on the full stack web-development course. 
</p>

<p>i completed my Diploma in december-2023 which I started on june-2017, I wasted 7 years of my life in this field and i don't think the people
  will hire me. But i'm constantly imporving myself to fit into this fast evolving world, and adapt it quite quickly.
